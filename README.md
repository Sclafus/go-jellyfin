# go-jellyfin

An API client library for Jellyfin music functionality for Go.

This code is an adaptation of the Jellyfin API implementation from the [Jellycli](https://github.com/tryffel/jellycli) project, originally written by Tero Vierimaa (@tryffel). Also a very helpful resource was the Jellyfin API layer of [Sonixd](https://github.com/jeffvli/sonixd).

The scope of this library is currently music-only, as it is being built for the [Supersonic](https://github.com/dweymouth/supersonic) project.

## Status

This library is functional, and currently in use in Supersonic. However, it is certainly not API stable and can be expected to change frequently.
